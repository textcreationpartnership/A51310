            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know at firſt ſight you'll judge me a Novice in the affairs of the World, in not pitching upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patron: and unacquainted with the Courtſhip of the times, that holds it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to toy and complement with a ſtranger, then ſpeak truth of a known friend. But I am me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating no Stage-play of ordinary Apiſh Civility, but ſober Truth: Nor intend this an act of worldly diſcretion and advantage, but of Juſtice and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. For I cannot hope that ever any man ſhall deſerve ſo well of me as your ſelf has done. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hath hitherto commended you to all that <pb facs="tcp:56208:3"/>know you; your Faithfulneſſe, Uprightneſse, Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for the publick Welfare of the place wherein you live, your generous Openneſſe and Veracity. Nor can ever that thick cloud you are now enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped with, of melancholized old Age, and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Adverſity, either dark the remembrance of your pristine Lustre, or hide from me the ſight of your preſent Worth. <hi>Sir,</hi> I could wiſh my ſelf a ſtranger to your bloud, that I might with the better decorum ſet out the nobleneſse of your ſpirit. But to ſpeak modeſtly; You deſerve the Patronage of better Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems then theſe, though you may lay a more proper claim to theſe then to any. You having from my childhood tuned mine ears to Spencers rhymes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining us on winter nights, with that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peice of his, <hi>The Fairy Queen,</hi> a Poem as richly fraught with divine Morality as Phanſy. Your early Encomiums alſo of Learning and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy did ſo fire my credulous Youth with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the knowledge of things, that your After-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, how contemptible Learning would prove without Riches, and what a piece of Unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlineſse and Incivility it would be held to ſeem wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then them, that are more wealthy and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:56208:3"/>could never yet reſtrain my mind from her firſt purſuit, nor quicken my attention to the affairs of the World. But this bookiſh diſeaſe let it make me as much poor as it will, it ſhall never make me the leſse juſt. Nor will you, I hope, eſteem me the leſse dutyfull, that without your cognoſcence I become thus thankfull. For I never held my ſelf bound to ask leave of any man to exerciſe an act of Virtue. And yet am I conſcious to my ſelf, there may have ſome juvenile Extravagancies paſsed my pen, which your judgement and gray hairs will more ſlowly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of, and my ſelf may happily diſlike by that time I arrive to half your years. But let it be my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that that which was to be made common for all, could not be ſo exactly fitted for any one Age or Perſon. I am not indeed much ſolicitous, how eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particle of theſe Poems may pleaſe you. In the mean time I am ſure I pleaſe my ſelf in the main; which is, The embalming of his name to Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that next under God, is the Authour of my Life and Being.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I ſeem too bold in preſenting my ſelf again ſo ſuddenly to publick view, let it excuſe me, at leaſt in part, that there is not ſo much boldneſſe in this, as in my firſt adventure. For whereas I had then no encouragement but mine own well meaning, and careleſſeneſſe of the opinions of men; I have now (beſide that reſolv'd neglect of mens haſty cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures) the experience (though unexpected) of the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance of the braveſt and beſt improved ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>For whoſe ſakes, and as many elſe as are at leaſure a while to lay aſide the pleaſure or trouble of the world, and entertain their minds with thoughts of a greater compaſſe then the fetching in of a little wealth or honour; I have taken the pains to peruſe theſe Poems of the ſoul, and to lick them into ſome more tolerable form and ſmoothneſſe. For I muſt confeſſe ſuch was the preſent haſte &amp; heat that I was then hurried in (diſpatching them in fewer moneths then ſome cold-pated-Gentlemen have conceited me to have ſpent years about them, and letting them ſlip from <pb facs="tcp:56208:6"/>me ſo ſuddenly, while I was ſo immerſe in the inward ſenſe and repreſentation of things, that it was even neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to forget the oeconomie of words, and leave them behind me aloft, to float and run together at randome like chaff and ſtraws on the ſurface of the water) that it could not but ſend them out in ſo uneven and rude a dreſſe. Nor yet can I, (I profeſſe) ever hope to find lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or patience ſo exquiſitely to poliſh them, as fully to anſwer mine own curioſity, if I would be alſo humorous, or the delicacy of ſome Lady-wits that can like nothing that is not as compos'd as their own hair, or as ſmooth as their Miſtreſſes Looking-glaſſe. But may theſe emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations prove but acceptable to the more generous and manly Genius; I ſhall pleaſe my ſelf enough, if I prove but tolerable to thoſe female phanſies.</p>
                  <p>But as I would not induſtriouſly neglect theſe, ſo I hope I have more ſolidly gratifi'd the other, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of this Poem. For beſides the Canto of the <hi>INFINITY</hi> of <hi>WORLDS,</hi> I have alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another of the <hi>PRAEEXISTENCY</hi> of the <hi>SOUL,</hi> where I have ſet out the nature of <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITS</hi> and given an account of
<hi>APPARITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS</hi> and <hi>WITCH-CRAFT,</hi> very anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able I conceive to experience and ſtory, invited to that talk by the frequent diſcoveries of this very Age. Which if they were publickly recorded, and that courſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in euery Pariſh, it would prove one of the beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes againſt that earthly and cold diſeaſe of Sadduciſme and Atheiſme, which may eaſily grow upon us, if not prevented, to the hazard of all Religion, and the beſt kinds of Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo enlarged the ſecond Canto of
<hi>PSY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHOZOIA,</hi> and have added (that I might avoid all ſuſpicion of partiality) to <hi>Pſittaco</hi> and <hi>Pithecus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <pb facs="tcp:56208:6"/>other perſons, <hi>Pico, Corvino, Graculo,</hi> and <hi>Glaucis,</hi> but am ſo ſenſible of that ſober precept in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which he affirms to be out of Moſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that I would be very loth to be ſo farre miſtaken as to be thought a Cenſurer or Contemner of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Religions or Opinions, if they ſerve God in them in the ſimplicity and ſincerity of their hearts, and have ſome more precious
<hi>ſubſtratum</hi> within, then inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate cuſtome or naturall complexion. All that I mean is this: That neither eager promoting of Opinion or Ceremony, nor the earneſt oppoſing of the ſame, no not the acuteneſſe of Reaſon, nor yet a ſtrong, if naked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that we have the Spirit of God, can excuſe a man from being in any better condition then in the Land of Brutes or in the mere animal nature. Which concluſion I thought worth my labour to ſet off with ſuch Artifice and Circumſtance as I have; the gullery and deceit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if not avoided, being of ſo great and evil conſequence. For if we can but once entitle our opinions and miſtakes to Religion, and Gods Spirit, it is like running quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver in the back of a ſword, and will enable us to ſtrike to utter deſtruction and ruine. But it would prevent a great deal of bloud and bitterneſſe in the Chriſtian world, if we reſerved the flower and ſtrength of our zeal for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth of God and his immutable Righteouſneſſe, and were more mildly and moderately affected concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Traditions and determinations of the Elders.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I have added Notes for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not onely of my <hi>Pſychozoia,</hi> but of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy. In both which I would be ſo underſtood, as a Repreſenter of the Wiſdome of the Ancients rather then a warranter of the ſame. Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations concerning the dry eſſence of the Diety are very conſuming and unſatisfactory. 'Tis better to drink of the <pb facs="tcp:56208:7"/>bloud of the grape, then bite the root of the vine, to ſmell of the roſe then, chew the ſtalk. And bleſſed be God, the meaneſt of men are capable of the former, very few ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull in the latter. And the leſſe, becauſe the reports of them that have buſied themſelves that way, have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeem'd ſtrange to the vulgar, but even repugnant with one another. But I ſhould in charity referre this to the nature of the pigeons neck, rather then to miſtake or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. One and the ſame Object in Nature affords many and different <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And God is as infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as ſimple. Like a circle, indifferent, whether you ſuppoſe it of one Uniform line, or an infinite number of Angles. Wherefore it is more ſafe to admit all poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in God, then raſhly to deny what appears not to us in our particular poſture.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo adjoyned ſome few ſcattering notes to the ſecond part of the <hi>Song of the Soul.</hi> Where I have alſo, beſide ſome ſubtil conſiderations concerning <hi>ATOMS</hi> and
<hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ANTITY,</hi> ſet out very plainly, the <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Copernicus</hi> concerning the <hi>MOTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON</hi> of the <hi>EARTH,</hi> as alſo opened the myſtery of the <hi>FL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>X</hi> and
<hi>REFL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>X</hi> of the <hi>SEA.</hi> Which two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations are not inferiour to any, for either pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in themſelves, or conducibleneſſe for the finding out of the right frame of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I have caſt into this ſecond Edition ſeverall ſmaller Poems, of which together with all the reſt that I have publiſhed I would give this generall Advertiſement,
<q>Est pictura Poeſis.</q> Every poem is an Idyllium. And a Poet no more ſings himſelf, then a Painter draws his own picture. Nor can I by theſe aſſume to my ſelf the honour of being a Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, no more then Virgil incurre the ſuſpicion of being an Epicurean by his Silenus, whom notwithſtanding Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander <pb facs="tcp:56208:7"/>Severus thought good to ſtyle
<hi>poetarum</hi> Plato.</p>
                  <p>As for a more determinate deciſion of thoſe many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations which I have ſet on foot in theſe writings, though I made ſome kind of promiſe that way in my firſt, I muſt crave leave a while to deferre it, till I find the thing it ſelf of more conſequence, and my ſelf at better leiſure. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without that, there is ſo great acceſſion made to this ſecond Edition, that I eaſily hope, that of as many as I was received favourably before, that I ſhall now be received with much more favour.</p>
                  <p>As for others, whom ſenſuall immerſion or the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Melancholy have more deeply ſeiz'd upon, I muſt acknowledge that in my own judgement I can ſeem no better to them then a piece of highly inacted folly, they obſtinately preferring that ſad ground of incredulity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing leſſe then a Demonſtration. For whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction <hi>Mounſieur des Chartes</hi> hath attempted bravely, but yet methinks on this ſide of Mathematicall evidence. He and that learned Knight our own Countryman had done a great deal more if they had promiſed leſſe. So high confidence might become the heat and ſcheme of Poetry much better then ſober Philoſophy. Yet has he not done nothing, though not ſo much as he raiſeth mens expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to. And if he had performed leſſe, it had been enough to ſouls that have well recovered that divine ſagacity and quick ſent of their own Intereſt. If this ſweet ethereall gale of divine breathing do not quicken and enliven the ſent and reliſh of ſuch arguments as Reaſon, Nature, and ſtory will afford, they will all prove weak and uſeleſſe: Eſpecially to exerciſed Wits that have ſo writhen and wreſted their phanſies that they can imagine or disimagine any thing, ſo weakened it that it is born down aſwel with the ſmalleſt as greateſt weight: ſo cruſted and made hard their inward
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by overmuch and triviall wearing <pb facs="tcp:56208:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, that that delicate diſcrimination and divine touch of the ſoul is even loſt, in ſo much that it would be ſafer to ask the judgement of young lads or Countrey idiots concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of Arguments for Gods exiſtence or the Souls immortality, then thoſe lubricous Wits and overworn Philoſophers. And ſurely if we will but admit of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and her eye to be placed upon man, and this world to be his inſtruction, together with the undiſtorted ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of his own heart, theſe eaſie hints and pointings will be found no fallacious directions. And true opinion is as faithfull a Guide, as Neceſſity and Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>That obvious conceit of the nature of light and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, though perhaps falſe in it ſelf, yet is an eaſie and ſafe conductour to that grand Truth of the divine Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes held up by the whole Chriſtian world for theſe many hundred years and by more then have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves Chriſtians. How naturally are we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited from the appearing of men deceaſed, to think the ſoul ſurvives the body, though we may perverſly ſuppoſe that thoſe Apparitions are but our own imaginations, or that ſome ſportfull or over officious ſpirit puts himſelf in the form and faſhion of the deceaſed party? But what was the firſt and moſt eaſie ſuggeſtion, is ſuch a truth as all Ages and Nations without intermiſſion have embraced it. Nor yet will this be for a Demonſtration and winne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted aſſent with auſtere and melancholick tempers. Nor is reaſon unback'd with better principles mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſatisfiable in matters of this kind. Nor am I offended that it is not. For would it not be an overproportionated engine, to the again endangering of Cleombrotus neck, or too forcibly driving men to obedience if they had their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality as demonſtrable as; That the three angles in a triangle are equall to two right angles. Beſides it would prevent that fitting triall of the ſoul, how ſhe would be <pb facs="tcp:56208:8"/>affected if there were nothing to come; whence ſhe would not be able ſo ſenſibly to diſcover to her ſelf her own Hypocriſie or ſinceritie. Laſtly, that loving adherence and affectionate cleaving to God by Faith and divine ſenſe would be foreſtall'd by ſuch undeniable evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Nature. Which though it would very much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the naturall man, yet it would not prove ſo profitable to us, as in things appertaining to God. For ſeeing our moſt palpable evidence of the ſouls immortality is from an inward ſenſe, and this inward ſenſe is kept alive the beſt by devotion and purity, by freedome from worldly care and ſorrow, and the groſſer pleaſures of the body (otherwiſe her ethereall vehicle will drink in ſo much of earthy and mortall dregs, that the ſenſe of the ſoul will be changed, &amp; being outvoted as it were by the overſwaying number of terrene particles, which that ethereal nature hath ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imbib'd and incorporated with, ſhe will become in a manner corporeall, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as Jamblichus ſpeaks, and in the extremity of this weakneſſe and dotage will be eaſily drawn off to pronounce her ſelf ſuch as the body is, diſſolvable and mortall) therefore it is better for us that we become doubtfull of our immortall condition when we ſtray from that virgin-purity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpottedneſſe, that we may withdraw our feet from theſe paths of death, then that Demonſtration and Infallibility ſhould permit us to proceed ſo farre, that our immortality would prove an heavy diſadvantage. But this is meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them that are lovers of God and their own ſouls. For they that are at enmity with him deſire no ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but rather embrace all means of laying aſleep that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting truth; that they bear about with them ſo precious a charge as an immortall Spirit.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His firſt Canto, as you may judge by the names therein, was intended for a mere Platonicall deſcription of Univerſall life, or life that is omnipreſent, though not alike omnipreſent. As in Noahs Deluge, the water that overflowed the earth was preſent in every part thereof, but every part of the water was not in every part of the earth, or all in every part; ſo the low Spirit of the Univerſe, though it go quite through the world, yet it is not totally in every part of the world; Elſe we ſhould heare our Antipodes, if they did but whiſper: Becauſe our lower man is a part of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Spirit of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ahad, Aeon,</hi> and <hi>Pſyche</hi> are all omnipreſent in the World, after the moſt perfect way that humane reaſon can conceive of. For they are in the world all totally and at once every where.</p>
                     <p>This is the famous Platonicall Triad: which though they that ſlight the Chriſtian Trinity do take for a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet I think it is no contemptible argument, that the Platoniſts, the beſt and divineſt of Philoſophers, and the Chriſtians, the beſt of all that do profeſſe religion, do both concur that there is a Trinity. In what they differ, I leave to be found out according to the ſafe direction of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule of Faith, the holy Word.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I ſhall not be blamed by any thing but ignorance and malignity, for being invited to ſing of the ſecond Unity of the Platonicall Triad, in a Chriſtian <pb facs="tcp:56208:12"/>and Poeticall ſcheme, that which the holy Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth of the ſecond Perſon of the Chriſtian Trinity. As that his patrimony is the poſſeſſion of the whole earth. For if it be not all one with Chriſt, according to his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet the Platoniſts placing him in the ſame order, and giving him the like attributes, with the Perſon of the Sonne in Chriſtianity, it is nothing harſh for me to take occaſion from hence to ſing a while the true Chriſtian <hi>Autocalon,</hi> whoſe beauty ſhall adorn the whole Earth in good time; if we believe the Prophets. For that hath not as yet happened. For Chriſt is not where ever his Name is: but as he is the Truth, ſo will he be truely diſplayed upon the face of the whole Earth. For God doth not fill the World with his Glory by words and ſounds, but by Spirit, and Life, and Reality.</p>
                     <p>Now this Eternall life I ſing of, even in the middeſt of Platoniſme: for I cannot conceal from whence I am, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt; but yet acknowledging, that God hath not left the Heathen, <hi>Plato</hi> eſpecially, without witneſſe of himſelf. Whoſe doctrine might ſtrike our adulterate Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors with ſhame &amp; aſtoniſhment; their lives falling ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſhort of the better Heathen. How far ſhort are they then of that admirable and tranſcendent high myſtery of true Chriſtianiſme? To which <hi>Plato</hi> is a very good ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient Miniſter; whoſe Philoſophy I ſinging here in a full heat; why may it not be free for me to break out into an higher ſtrain, and under it to touch upon ſome points of Chriſtianity; as well as all-approved <hi>Spencer,</hi> ſings of Chriſt under the name of
<hi>Pan?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo transfers thoſe things that be ſpoken of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to God himſelf, Arat. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>So then the proper effect of this third Hypoſtaſis in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trinity is Love, which compleateth the Circle, and reduceth us again to the firſt Principle of all, the ſimple and abſolute good which we enjoy by this ſingle Act or Energie of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> divine Love: and this is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This trinall effect or ſpirituall influence on the Soul is experientially true: But this threefold Hypoſtaſis, <hi>viz. Ahad, Aeon,</hi> and <hi>Pſyche,</hi> cannot be known by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but is rather concluded by collection of reaſon. Nor indeed is reaſon it ſelf able ſufficiently to confirm or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, ſith it can conceive that one ſingle Eſſence can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many and various functions as doth the Soul, that being one, unfolds her ſelf into varieties of operations.</p>
                     <p>Yet have the Platoniſts eſtabliſhed their Triad upon no contemptible grounds which I will not be ſo tedious as here to relate: but give the Reader leave to peruſe <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> at his leiſure. And I muſt confeſſe that that myſtery ſeems to me a thing of it ſelf, ſtanding on its own Baſis, and to happen rather to agree with ſome Principles of Chriſtianiſme, then to be drawn from the holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt is, that the happineſſe of man is not the Eſſence, but the Influence of the Divinity; and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb facs="tcp:56208:14"/>in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, of more conſequence then to read and underſtand all the curious and acute ſchool-tracts of the Trinity. For this may be permitted to the Divel: that is the priviledge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the good and pious man. Nor is it any wonder at all.</p>
                     <p>For be it ſo that the contemplation of theſe things is very ſublime and ſubtile, yet well I wot they are nothing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the ſoul. For the exile Theories of the Infinity of God and Trinity, are but as it were the dry meaſuring and numbering of the Deity, and profit as much to the ſoul devoid of charity, as the Diametre of the Sunnes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or the remembrance of that trinall property in <hi>Lux Lumen</hi> and Calefaction can warm a man in a cold froſty night.</p>
                     <p>But if any man would be ſufficiently initiated into theſe myſteries, he muſt repair to the ever living Word of God, that ſubtile and ſearching fire, that will ſift all the

                     <p>THis ſecond Canto, before we deſcend to particular lives, exhibits to our apprehenſion, by as fit a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude as I could light upon, the Univerſe, as one ſimple <pb facs="tcp:56208:15"/>uniform being from Ahad to Hyle, no particular ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being as yet being made; no earth or any other Orb as yet kned together. All homogeneall, ſimple, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, pure, pervious, unknotted, uncoacted, nothing exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting but thoſe eight univerſall orders.</p>
                     <p>There God hath full command, builds and deſtroyes what he liſts.</p>
                     <p>That all our ſouls are free effluxes from his eſſence. What follows is ſo plain that the Reader wants no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</p>

                  <div n="3" type="canto">
                     <head>Vpon the third Canto.</head>
                     <p>THere is no knot at all in this laſt Canto, if men do not ſeek one. I plainly and poſitively declare no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but ſhew the abuſe of thoſe opinions there touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crouding a number of enormities together; that eaſily ſhroud themſelves there, where all ſinfulneſſe ſurely may eaſily get harbour, if we be not yet well aware of the Devil, that makes true opinions oftentimes ſerve for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                     <p>Nothing elſe can be now expected for the eaſie and profitable underſtanding of this Poem, but the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the names that frequently occurre in it. Which I will interpret at the end of theſe Books; (as alſo the hard terms of the other Poems) for their ſakes whoſe real worth and underſtanding is many times equall with the beſt, onely they have not fed of husks and ſhels, as others have been forced to do, the ſuperficiary knowledge of tongues. But it would be well, that neither the Linguiſt would contemne the illiterate for his ignorance, nor the ignorant condemn the learned for his knowledge, For it is not unlearnedneſſe that God is ſo pleaſed withall, or ſillineſſe and emptineſſe of mind, but ſingleneſſe and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart.</p>

                  <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He very nerves and ſinews of Religion is hope of immortality. What greater incitement to virtue and juſtice then eternall happineſſe? what greater terrour from wickedneſſe, then a full perſwaſion of after-judgement and continuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſpirit? But my labour is ſuperfluous, Men from their very childhood are perſwaded of theſe things. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I fear how they are perſwaded of them when they become men. Elſe would not they whom the fear of hell doth not afright, die ſo unwillingly, nor wicked men ſo ſecurely; nor would ſo many be wicked. For even naturall-providence would bid them look forward.</p>
                  <p>Beſide ſome men of a melancholick temper (which commonly diſtruſt and ſuſpicion do accompany) though otherwiſe pious, yet out of an exceeding deſire of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall being, think they can never have ſecurity enough for this ſo pleaſing hope and expectation, and ſo even with anxiety of mind buſie themſelves to prove the truth of that ſtrongly, which they deſire vehemently to be true. And this body, which diſſolution waits upon, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infidelity exceedingly. For the ſoul not ſeeing it ſelf, judgeth it ſelf of ſuch a nature, as thoſe things are to which ſhe is neareſt united: Falſely ſaith, but yet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, I am ſick, I am weak, I faint, I die; when it is nought but the periſhing life of the body that is in ſuch plight, to which ſhe is ſo cloſe tyed in moſt intimate love and ſympathy. So a tender mother, if ſhe ſee a knife ſtruck to her childs heart, would ſhreek and ſwound as if her ſelfe had been ſmit; when as if her eye had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <pb facs="tcp:56208:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>that ſpectacle, ſhe had not been moved though the thing were ſurely done. So I do verily think that the mind being taken up in ſome higher contemplation, if it ſhould pleaſe God to keep it in that ecſtaſie, the body might be deſtroyed without any diſturbance to the ſoul. for how can there be or ſenſe or pain without animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
                  <p>But while we have ſuch continuall commerce with this frail body, it is not to be expected, but that we ſhall be aſſaulted with the fear of death and darkneſſe. For alas! how few are there that do not make this viſible world, their Adonai, their ſtay and ſuſtentation of life, the prop of their ſoul, their God? How many Chriſtians are not prone to whiſper that of the Heathen Poet,

                           <l>Deep ſleep us binds with iron chain,</l>

                  <p>But I would not be ſo injurious, as to make men worſe then they are, that my little work may ſeem of greater uſe and worth then it is.</p>
                  <p>Admit then that men are moſt what perſwaded of the ſouls immortality, yet here they may read reaſons to confirm that perſwaſion, and be put in mind, as they reade, of their end, and future condition, which cannot be but profitable at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>For the pleaſure they'll reap from this Poem, it will be according as their Genius is fitted for it. For as Plato ſpeaks in his Io,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or according to the more uſuall phraſe
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. The ſpirit of every Poet is not alike, nor his writings <pb facs="tcp:56208:54"/>alike ſuitable to all diſpoſitions. As Io, the reciter of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers verſes, profeſſeth himſelf to be ſnatcht away with an extradodinary fury or ecſtaſie at the repeating of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Poeſie, but others ſo little to move him that he could even fall aſleep. So that no man is raſhly to condemn an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans labour in this kind, becauſe he is not taken with it. As wiſe or wiſer then himſelfe may.</p>
                  <p>But this is a main piece of idolatry and injuſtice in the world, that every man would make his private Genius an univerſall God; and would devour all mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions by his own fire, that glowes ſo hot in him, and (as he thinks) ſhines ſo clear.</p>
                  <p>As for this preſent ſong of the Immortality of the ſoul, it is not unlikely but that it will prove ſung <hi>Montibus &amp; Sylvis</hi> to the waſte woods and ſolitary mountains. For all men are ſo full of their own phanſies and idiopathies, that they ſcarce have the civility to interchange any words with a ſtranger. If they chance to hear his exotick tone, they entertain it with laughter, a paſſion very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon that occaſion to children and clowns. But it were much better neither to emboſome nor reject any thing, though ſtrange, till we were well acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>Exquiſite diſquiſition begets diffidence; diffidence in knowledge, humility; humility, good manners and meek converſation. For mine own part, I deſire no man to take any thing I write, upon truſt, without canvaſing; and would be thought rather to propound then to aſſert what I have here or elſewhere written. But continually to have expreſt my diffidence in the very tractates themſelves, had been languid and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>It were a piece of injuſtice to expect of others, that which I could never indure to ſtoop to my ſelf. That knowledge which is built upon humane authority, is <pb facs="tcp:56208:55"/>no better then a Caſtle in the Aire. For what man is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or at leaſt can be proved to us to be ſo? Wherefore the foundation of that argument will but prove preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that is ſo built. And we have rather a ſound of words ſignifying the thing is ſo, then any true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the thing is ſo indeed.</p>
                  <p>What ever may ſeeme ſtrange in this Poem, condemne it not, till thou findeſt it diſſonant to Plato's School, or not deducible from it. But there be many arguments, that have no ſtrangeneſſe at all to prove the Souls immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that no man that is not utterly illiterate ſhall loſe his labour in reading this ſhort Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe I intended to ſpin it out to a greater length; but things of greater importance then curious Theory, take me off; beſide the hazard of ſpeaking hard things to a multitude.</p>
                  <p>I make no queſtion, but thoſe that are rightly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Platoniſme, will accept of that ſmall pains, and make a good conſtruction of my labours. For I well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee (Reader) that it will be nothing but ignorance of my ſcope, that ſhall make any do otherwiſe. I fly too high to take notice of leſſer flaws. If thou ſeeſt them, I give thee free liberty to mend them. But if thou regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not leſſer trifles, we be well met.</p>

                  <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O preface much concerning theſe little after-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Poetry, I hold needleſſe, having ſpoke my mind ſo fully before. The motives that drew me to adde them to the former are expreſt in the Poems themſelves. My drift is one in them all: which is to raiſe a certain number of well ordered Phantaſms, fitly ſhaped out and warily contrived, which I ſet to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and conflict with all the furious phanſies of Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme and Atheiſme. But here's my diſadvantage, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory will be no victory, unleſſe the adverſary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himſelfe overcome. None can acknowledge himſelf overcome, unleſſe he perceive the ſtrength, and feel the ſtroke of the more powerfull arguments. But the exility and ſubtilty of many, and that not of the meaneſt, is ſuch (nor can they be otherwiſe) that they will (as that kind of thunder which the Poets do commonly call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from its over quick and penetrating energie) go through their more <hi>porous</hi> and ſpongy minds without any ſenſible impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Sure I am that ſenſuality is alwayes an enemy to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of reaſon, which hath its riſe from ſubtilty of phanſie: ſo that the life of the body, being vigorous and radiant in the ſoul, hinders us of the ſight of more attenuate phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes, But that being ſuppreſt or very much caſtigate and kept under, our inward apprehenſion grows clearer and larger. Few men can imagine any thing ſo clearly awake, as they did when they were aſleep, And what's the reaſon, but that the ſenſe of the body is then bound up or dead in a manner?</p>
                  <p>The dark glaſſe-windows will afford us a further il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration for this purpoſe. Why is it that we ſee our own
<pb facs="tcp:56208:130"/>faces there by night? What can reflect the ſpecies (as they phraſe it) when the glaſſe is pervious and tranſparent? Surely reflexion in the ordinary apprehenſion is but a conceit. The darkneſſe behind the glaſſe is enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit viſibly the forms of things within, by hiding ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger objects from the eye, which would bury theſe weak idola in their more orient luſtre.</p>
                  <p>The ſtarres ſhine and fill the air with their ſpecies by day, but are to be ſeen onely in a deep pit, which may fence the Suns light from ſtriking our ſight ſo ſtrongly. Every contemptible candle conquers the beams of the Moon, by the ſame advantage that the Suns doth the Starrs, viz. propinquitie. But put out the candle, and you will preſently find the moon-light in the room; exclude the moon, and then the feebleſt of all ſpecies will ſtep out into energy, we ſhall behold the night.</p>
                  <p>All this is but to ſhew, how the ſtronger or nearer
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth obſcure the weaker or further off; and how that one being removed, the energie of the other will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear.</p>
                  <p>Now that our compariſon may be the fitter, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Ariſtotle ſaith of phanſie, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Thus much I will take of him, that Phanſie is ſenſe; and adde to it that
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and what I have intimated in ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of theſe Poems, that the ſoul doth alwayes feel it ſelf, its own actuall Idea, by its omniform centrall ſelf. So that the immediate ſenſe of the ſoul is nothing elſe but to perceive its own energie.</p>
                  <p>Now ſith that, that which we call outward ſenſe, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very energie of the ſoul, and inward ſenſe which is phanſie can be no other, there ſeems to be no reall and intrinſecall difference betwixt the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of any form; no more then there is betwixt a frog born by <pb facs="tcp:56208:130"/>the Sunne and mere ſlime, and one born by copulation: For theſe are but extrinſecall relations. Wherefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the ſoul it ſelf is all one.</p>
                  <p>But now ſith it is the ſame nature, why is not there the ſame degrees in both? I ſay there is, as appears plainly in ſleep, where we find all as clear and energeticall as when we wake.</p>
                  <p>But here theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (for I have prov'd them all one) do as greater and leſſer lights dim one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or that which is neareſt worketh ſtronglieſt. Hence it is that the light or life of this low ſpirit or body of ours, ſtirring up the ſoul into a perpetuall ſenfuall energie, if we foſter this and unite our minds, will, and animadverſion with it, will by its cloſe neareneſſe with the ſoul dim and obſcure thoſe more ſubtil and exile phantaſms or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> riſen from the ſoul it ſelf, or occaſioned by other mens writings. For they will be in the flaring light or life of the body as the ſtarres in the beams of the Sunne ſcarce to be ſeen, unleſſe we withdraw our ſelves out of the fluſh vigour of that light, into the profundity of our own ſouls, as into ſome deep pit.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore men of the moſt tam'd and caſtigate ſpirits are of the beſt and moſt profound judgement, becauſe they can ſo eaſily withdraw themſelves from the life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the lower ſpirit of this body.</p>
                  <p>Thus being quit of paſſion, they have upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a clear though ſtill and quiet repreſentation of every thing in their minds, upon which pure bright ſydereall phantaſms unprejudiced reaſon may ſafely work, and clearly diſcern what is true or probable.</p>
                  <p>If my writings fall into the hands of men otherwiſe qualified, I ſhall gain the leſſe approbation. But if they will endeavour to compoſe themſelves as near as they can to this temper; though they were of another opinion <pb facs="tcp:56208:131"/>then what my writings intend to prove, I doubt not but they will have the happineſſe to be overcome, and to prove gainers by my victory.</p>
                  <p>To ſay any thing more particularly concerning theſe laſt I hold it needleſſe. Onely let me excuſe my ſelf, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chance to blame me for my <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as confuting that which no man will aſſert. For it hath been aſſerted by ſome; as thoſe Mauri whom Ficinus ſpeaks of; and the queſtion is alſo diſcuſſed by Plotinus in his fourth Ennead, where he diſtinguiſheth of, <hi>all ſouls being one,</hi> after this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The latter member is that, which my arguments conclude againſt. though they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> yet were we ſafe enough; as ſafe as the beams of the Sun the Sun exiſting. But the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Praxiteles broken glaſſe is brought in, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the apprehenſion of ſuch, as make the image to vaniſh into nothing, the glaſſe being taken away: and that as there is but one face, though there be the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many; ſo though there be the appearances of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls, by reaſon of that ones working in divers bodies, yet there is but one ſoul; and underſtanding ſenſe and motion to be the acts of this one ſoul informing ſeverall bodies.</p>
                  <p>This is that which both Plotinus and I endeavour to deſtroy, which is of great moment: For if one onely ſoul act in every body, what ever we are now, ſurely this body laid in the duſt we ſhall be nothing.</p>
                  <p>As for the Oracles anſwer to Amelius, if any vulgar conceited man think it came from a devil with Bats wings and a long tail, the Seventies tranſlation of the eight verſe of the 32. chapter of Deuteronomy may make it at leaſt doubtfull. <hi>When the moſt High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he ſeparated the ſonnes of Adam he ſet the bounds of the people,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <pb facs="tcp:56208:131"/>He did not then deliver them into the hand and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of devils, nor to be inſtructed and taught by them.</p>
                  <p>But if Apollo who gave ſo good a teſtimony of Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes while he was living, and of Plotinus after his death, was ſome foul fiend, yet tis no prejudice to their eſteem, ſince our Saviour Chriſt was acknowledged by the devil.</p>
                  <p>But I have broke my word, by not breaking off before this. Reader, tis time now to leave thee to the peruſall of my writings, which if they chance to pleaſe thee, I repent me not of my pains; if they chance not to pleaſe, that ſhall not diſpleaſe me much, for I conſider that I alſo with ſmall content and pleaſure have read the writings of other men.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the opinion of the Praeexiſtency of the Soul be made ſo probable and paſſable in the Canto it ſelf, that none can ſleight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it, that do not ordinarily approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men by Deriſion more then by Reaſon; yet ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie prejudice lying upon us both from Naturall diffidence in ſo high Points, and from our common Education, I thought it fit, for ſeeuring my ſelf, from ſuſpicion of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much lightneſſe, to premize thus much: That that which I have taken the pains and boldneſſe to preſent to the free judgement of others, hath been already judged of old, very ſound and orthodox, by the wiſeſt and moſt learned of preceding Ages.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>R. Menaſſeh Ben-Iſrael,</hi> doth abundantly atteſt in his 15. <hi>Problem. De Creatione;</hi> Avouching that it is the common Opinion of all the Hebrews, and that it was never called into controverſie, but approved of, by the common conſent and ſuffrage of all wiſe men.</p>
                  <p>And himſelf doth by ſeverall places out of the Old Teſtament (as pat for his purpoſe, I think, as any can be brought againſt it) endeavour to make it good; but might I confeſſe, have been more fitly furniſhed, could his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have reached into the New. For
<hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3.
<hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. all thoſe places do ſeem ſo naturally to favour this Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that if it had pleas'd the Church to have concluded it for a ſtanding Truth; He that would not have been fully convinc'd upon the evidence of theſe paſſages of Scripture, would undoubtedly, have been held a man of a very ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous &amp; Scepticall conſtitution, if not ſomething worſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the feebleneſſe and miſerable ineptneſſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy <pb facs="tcp:56208:151"/>any greater damp to the belief of this Preexiſtency then the dotage and debility of old Age, to the hope of the Souls future ſubſiſtency after death,</p>
                  <p>Nor, if we would fetch an argument from Theologie, is Gods Juſtice, and the divine Nemeſis leſſe ſet out, by ſuppoſing that the Souls of men, thorough their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting from God before they came into the body, have thus in ſeverall meaſures engaged themſelves in the ſad, dangerous, and almoſt fatall entanglements of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall World; then it is, by conceiving that they muſt needs ſurvive the Body, that the judgement of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may paſſe upon them, for what they have committed in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Nor laſtly, is it harder to phanſie, how theſe Praeexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Souls inſinuate into ſeed, Embryos, or Infants, then how Created ones are inſinuated; nor yet ſo hard, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of their condition if they depart in Infancy, as of the condition of theſe.</p>
                  <p>But miſtake me not, Reader; I do not contend (in thus arguing) that this opinion of the Praeexiſtency of the Soul, is true, but that it is not ſuch a ſelf-condemned Falſity, but that I might without juſtly incurring the cenſure of any Vainneſſe or Levity, deem it worthy the canvaſe and diſcuſſion of ſober and conſiderate men.</p>

<hi>Pſyche</hi> as being effluxes from her, it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable that the leaſt motions of the mind, or ſtilleſt thought ſhould eſcape her.</p>
                     <p>But if any man be puzled how the phantaſie of a mans ſoul ſhould make an impreſſion upon any part of the univerſall ſpirit of the world, and <hi>Semele</hi> ſhould not, let him conſider, that the imaginative operations of <hi>Pſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> are more high, more hovering and ſuſpenſe from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion into the groſſer ſpirits of this body, which is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing conſcious of whats done ſo farre above, and ſo not receiving the impreſſe of ſo high acts, it ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens (even in the exaltation of our own phanſie) that memory fails. And beſides this, as the vigour of ſenſe debilitates or quite extinguiſheth the ordinary imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul, ſo doth her ordinary imaginations, or ſenſe, or both, hinder the animadverſion of the impreſſes of
<hi>Semele.</hi> But particular imaginations and the vigour of ſenſe weakened or extinct in ſleep, or near death, the energies of the ſoul of the world are then more percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, probably, even in the very ſpirit of our body, as well as in the naked ſoul: hence come prophetick dreams and true predictions before death.</p>
                     <p>But to go back to the apprehenſions of <hi>Pſyche.</hi> Every ſenſible object and every ſenſitive and imaginative act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before her, and whatſoever is in her ſight, is alſo in the ſight of
<hi>Aeon.</hi> Becauſe the union betwixt <hi>Aeon</hi> and <hi>Pſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> is much more near then between <hi>Pſyche</hi> and the Mundane ſpirit. And whatſoever is repreſented in <hi>Aeon</hi> is alſo clearly in the view of
<hi>Ahad;</hi> by reaſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſeable cloſe unity of theſe two; ſo that <hi>Ahad</hi> knowes every individuall thing and motion, as clearly, nay more clearly then any mortall eye can view any one thing, let it look never ſo ſteddily on it.</p>
                     <p>Thus the thoughts of all mens minds and motions of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56208:200"/>heart ariſe up into the ſight and preſence of the all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Divinity, as neceſſarily and naturally as reek or fume of frankincenſe rouls up into the open air.

                     <p>And that the world is inacted by <hi>Pſyche,</hi> and ſo is (which <hi>Triſmegist</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> are not nice to grant) one intire Animal, and that therefore nothing can ſcape the knowledge of that univerſall ſoul, no more then any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, imagination, or motion of man can be hid from the ſoul of man, if ſhe be at leaſure to obſerve it. That <hi>Pſyche</hi> is at leaſure being uncapable of diſtraction, as whoſe animadverſion is infinite, entirely omnipreſent, and every where at once.</p>
                     <p>And now I have taken the pains ſo accurately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Deity, me thinks, I have made my ſelf obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious <pb n="352" facs="tcp:56208:201"/>to almoſt a juſt cenſure of too much boldneſſe and curioſity.</p>
                     <p>But give me leave to anſwer, that I have not taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me ſo much to ſet out the abſolute nature of God, as thoſe Notions that
<hi>Plato's</hi> School have framed of Him, Which I hold neither my ſelf nor any man elſe engaged to embrace for Oracles, though they were true, 'till ſuch time as they appear to him to be ſo. But how ever, I think all men are to interpret both <hi>Plato</hi> and all men elſe at the beſt, and rather mark what of undoubted truth they aime at, then quarrell and entangle themſelves in diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner of expreſſing that which no man can reach unto. As for example, I had rather fill my mind with that unqueſtionable truth exhibited in their Triad, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is as fully Goodneſſe, Wiſedome, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Love, as if there were three ſuch diſtinct Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes in the Deity, and then that he is as ſurely one with himſelf as if there were but one onely Hypoſtaſis, then to perplex my mind with troubleſome queſtions of Three and One, and One and three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the mind of man being ſo unable to conceive any thing of the naked being of God, thoſe more groſſe and figurate repreſentations of Him, ſo be they be ſutable to &amp; expreſſive of His unqueſtionable Attributes, are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſable but convenient for created underſtandings, to lead them on in the contemplation of God in eaſie Love and Triumph. Whereas by endeavouring more Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially and determinately to comprehend and conclude that which is ſo unconcludible and incomprehenſible to the underſtanding of man, we work our ſelves into anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and ſubtile diſtemper and dry up the more precious outflowings of the Divinity in our ſouls, by this helliſh thirſt and importunate deſire of dealing with the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked eſſence of God. But let every modeſt Philoſopher <pb n="353" facs="tcp:56208:201"/>but read that Inſcription in

37. For to the impaſſible eternall being is the inheritance of the world there promiſed, but here to that which is paſſible and mortall. I anſwer, that the eternal and immortall ſonne of God is to take poſſeſſion of the world, <pb n="366" facs="tcp:56208:208"/>by that which after a manner is mortall and extinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is the energie of himſelf, exerted upon the ſouls of men, or a kind of life diffuſed in mans heart and ſoul, whereby God doth inact us, and is our <gap reason="foreign">

And if <hi>Aeon</hi> as he is the ſonne of <hi>Ahad</hi> or <hi>Atove</hi> (to ſpeak Platonically) that is, the ſimple and free good, or in brief as he is the ſonne of God, who is the ſimple good without all ſelf-neſſe or ſtraitneſſe, even pure and perfect Light it ſelf (for this
<hi>Aeon</hi> contains in him alſo the whole creature and is the eſſence or Idea of all things) I ſay if he as he is the ſonne of God be in us by his imparted life, he then takes poſſeſſion of the world, and God by him. But he hath not yet enquickened men generally with this Deiform life, but it hath lyen dead to them or they to it, that influx being rather ſuſpended then abſolutely deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as the ſoul to its body, or any part of her body that is numb and dead. But when that life ſhall flow into them, as the vitall rayes of the ſoul into this mortall body, He ſhall then as truly govern, rule, and poſſeſſe the world as any ſoul doth her body.</p>
                     <p>And that there is an eternall ſonne of God, immortall impaſſible, and not onely in the ſouls of men, but that fills the whole univerſe, the Evangeliſt I think will confirm.

                     <p>Now for the better underſtanding of thoſe degrees, we are to take notice of the firſt and ſecond motions that be in us.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, thoſe vertues that put away quite and extinguiſh the firſt motions, are Paradigmaticall, that is, virtues that make us anſwer to the Paradigme or Idea of virtues exactly, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intellect or God.</p>

Yet to ſpeak the truth, Stoiciſme, Platoniſme, and Pythagoriſme are gallant lights, and a noble ſpirit moves in thoſe Philoſophers vains, and ſo near-Chriſtianiſme, if a man will look on them favourably, that one would think they are baptized already not onely with water, but the holy Ghoſt. But I not ſeeing humility and ſelf-denyall and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own unworthineſſe of ſuch things as they aimed at, nor mortification, not of the body (for that's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſiſted upon) but of the more ſpiritual arrogative <pb n="372" facs="tcp:56208:211"/>life of the ſoul, that ſubtill aſcribing that to our ſelves that is Gods, for all is Gods; I ſay, I not ſeeing thoſe things ſo frequently, and of purpoſe inculcated in their writings, thought, I might fitly make their Philoſophy, or rather the life that it doth point at (for that's the ſubject of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em) a Type of that life which is very near to perfection, but as yet imperfect, having ſtill a ſmack of arrogation, and ſelf-ſeeking. But believe it, a man ſhall often meet with frequent Teſtimonies of their charity and univerſall love, of meekneſſe and tranquillity of mind, of common care of men, of hearty forgiveneſſe of offences. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Juſtice, and contempt of death, are obvious and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall; alſo their Prayer to God, and belief that he helps, both in finding out of Truth, and improvement of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. So that I reſerve as the true and adequate Character of Chriſtianiſme, the moſt profound and ſpirituall humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that any man can have experience of, and a perfect ſelf-deadneſſe, which is the begetter indeed of the former.

                           <p>Let the Sunne be in his Perigee A, enlightening the Earth CEHD ſo farre as FG. Remove him from A to his Apogee B.

                           <p>For ſuppoſe he had gone back but the length of IC, then had FCG been devoyd of light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that CG hath no more points in it then IC hath, by the firſt and ſecond Axiom. or third Appendix of the firſt Theorem. And the light cannot go off leſſe then an Atom a time by the fourth Axiom. Much more deſtitute therefore is the Earth CHED of light, the Sunne being in B, when as the diſtance <pb n="381" facs="tcp:56208:215"/>AB will meaſure above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times CH (which yet is bigger then IC) by the Conſect. of the third propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Aſtrnomicall, ſo that day will hang in the sky many thouſand miles off from us, faſtigiated into one conicall point, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come utterly deſtitute of light.</p>

                           <p>A man might as well with placing the Sunne in B firſt prove him to enlighten all the Earth at once, and make perfect day.</p>
                           <p>As alſo the Moon if you place her in her Apogee firſt, that ſhe enlightens not the leaſt particle of the Earth though in her full.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, if you place them in K you might prove they do enlighten every part and never a part of the Earth at once, ſo that a perfect Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall darkneſſe and light would poſſeſſe the World at the ſame time, which is little better then a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not new lines of the air but of immovable imaginary ſpace. which ſpaces let be aequall one with another. Now let the arrow K moving upward or downard in BC <pb n="386" facs="tcp:56208:218"/>make alſo toward the Eaſt A in a circular motion. I ſay then it goes faſter in E then in D. For the ark DA is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into parts of the ſame proportion to the whole D A that the parts of EA to the whole EA. Now EA is far greater then DA, and therefore muſt the parts of EA be far greater then the parts of DA. And yet in the ſame time doth the arrow K paſſe thorough the portion of EA that it doth of DA. otherwiſe it would not keep in the line BC which is contrary to our hypotheſis, and indeed to ordinary experience. For our eye finds the arrow come down in the ſame line it went up. Therefore it muſt needs go faſter in EA then DA.</p>
                        <p>But this may ſeem ſtrange and uncouth that the arrow ſhould thus moderate it ſelf in its motion, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its ſwiftneſſe to the ark it is in.

                        <p>The truth and ſenſe of this ſtanza will appear thus. Water is a heavie body, and therefore will get ſo near the centre as it can. That all the parts may get as near as they can, they muſt of neceſſity caſt themſelves into a ſphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call figure. For any other figure though it may happily let ſome parts nearer then they be in a ſphear, yet it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bears others further off from the Centre then the furtheſt would be, were they all caſt into a ſphericall, as plainly appears in the following Scheme.</p>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:56208:218"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Where let DA be a proportion of water caſting it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rectilinear figure. FG the ſame proportion caſting it ſelf into a ſphaericall. 'Tis plain that though DA be nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Centre at the point C and thereabout then FG at B or any where elſe, yet the higheſt point in the furface of FG is not ſo high, or ſo far remov'd from the centre I, as any betwixt DK or HA, wherefore all the particles of the proportion of water DA are not brought to the neareſt poſition to the centre I, till they conform with the circle CLM. which we ſuppoſe the ſame proportion of water FG to have done. wherefore the lubricous particles of the water DA, will never ceaſe tumbling, as being plac'd in an undue hight, till the ſurface thereof be concentricall with I.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>This being premiſed, let E be a veſſel of water in ſeverall ſituations of hight. The firſt and higheſt ſituation
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56208:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this veſſel let be BAB which is plainly the biggeſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Let CBC be the next, a leſſe circle then BAB. The tumour at B is bigger then, then at A. let <hi>B</hi>CB be the third, leſſer then any of the former, the tumour at C is then higheſt of all, and ſo on ſtill. There will ever be a new conformation of the ſurface of the water, according to the diſtance from the Centre of the earth, as is plain from the praemized Theorem.</p>

<hi>Landſbergius</hi> about the diſtances of the Planets from the Centre of the earth. For there <hi>Mars</hi> his leaſt diſtance muſt needs be lower then <hi>Venus</hi> greateſt diſtance, and <hi>Venus</hi> leſt diſtance muſt <pb n="389" facs="tcp:56208:219"/>needs be lower then <hi>Mercuries</hi> greateſt diſtance.

Here we may obſerve that every part of the earth at ſeverall times hath a contrary motion.</p>

                           <hi>As for example.</hi> Thoſe parts at D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tending toward E have a contrary motion to what they have when they come to F and aſcend toward G. So the parts twixt GD as they go on toward E, move contrary to the motion they are moved betwixt E F going on toward G. But the parts about D move one way with the annuall motion, ſo that the ſwiftneſſe of the motion of thoſe parts of the earth is increaſed, the annuall and diurnall motion going in one, and tending Eaſtward. But the parts about F go Weſtward toward G, ſo that much of the annuall ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is taken of by the diurnall motion in theſe parts, they going a contrary way to the annuall.</p>
                        <p>The parts about E and G go not either Weſtward or Eaſtward, but are inconſiderable in the annuall motion.</p>
                        <p>Now, ſaith <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> the ſea being in his channell as water in a movable veſſell the acceleration or retardation of the motion of the Earth will make the ſea fluctuate or ſwill, like water in a ſhaken veſſel, which muſt needs come to paſſe twice in every foure and twenty houres becauſe of the great ſwiftneſſe at D and extraordinary ſlowneſſe at F.</p>
                        <p>What the cauſe is of the dayly flux and reflux of the ſea according to <hi>Galilaeos</hi> mind is now conſpicuous. <hi>viz.</hi> The addition or ſubduction of the Earths diurnall motion from the annuall, which according to that Authours compute is thrice ſwifter then the diurnall.</p>
                        <p>Now as the dayly Flux and Reflux conſiſts in this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubduction, ſo the monethly and yearly changes and variations of this Flux and Reflux conſiſt in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or change of proportion in thoſe additions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions: they bearing ſometime leſſe, ſometime greater proportion to the annuall motion.</p>
                        <p>Finally, this variation of proportions ariſeth either from
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56208:221"/>a new ſwiftneſſe or ſlowneſſe in the annuall motion of the Earth; or elſe, from the various poſition of the Axis thereof; it ſometimes conſpiring more fully with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion then other ſometimes. Whenc it comes to paſſe that the compound motion is not alwayes of the ſame ſwiftneſſe or ſlowneſſe. But we ſhall better underſtand this by applying our ſelves to a figure. And firſt of the moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly variation at full and new Moon.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>But here I muſt profeſſe it ſeems to me very hard, how the ſwiftneſſe of the Moon in B, or her ſlowneſſe in the Ark H D G ſhould engage the Earth in C, in the like ſlowneſſe and ſwiftneſſe, there being no ſuch ſolid and ſtiff continuation from A to D as there is in a balance of a clock.</p>
                        <p>Again ſuppoſing this conceit to hold good. How will it anſwer to the hiſtory of the Flux and Reflux of the ſea. Which is increaſed much, as well when the Moon is in B as when ſhe is in D. That the Flux ſhould be greater the Moon being in D is reaſonable, becauſe C being then much retarded in the annuall motion, the ſubduction and addition of the diurnall will bear a greater proportion to the annuall, and ſo conſequently cauſe a greater alteration in the Flux and Reflux. But when as the Moon being in B makes the annuall motion of C ſwifter, the ſubduction and addition of the diurnall will bear a leſſe proportion to the annuall, and ſo the Flux and Reflux ſhall be rather diminiſhed then increaſed, which is againſt experience and the hiſtory of the Flux and Reflux of the ſea.</p>
                        <p>But now in the third place, to find out the reaſon why at certain points of the years period the Flux and Reflux ſhould be increaſed. We muſt obſerve that this is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeverall poſitions of the Axis of the Earth, not but that it is alwayes parallel to it ſelf, but in reference to the Ecliptick. For ſuch is its poſition in the Solſtitiall points <pb n="395" facs="tcp:56208:222"/>that there the diurnall motion added or ſubducted bears a greater proportion to the annuall then elſewhere. In the Equinoctiall points a leſſe. As will appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcheme.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Let ADCB be the Ecliptick, Let the circles GCFE cut ADCB to right angles. Let the annuall motion of the Earth be from C to B, from B to A, &amp;c. the diurnall CAEC and CBEC. The Earth at A in her Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiall point: at B in her Equinoctiall. It is plain at firſt ſight that CAEC complies much more with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion BAD, then CBE doth with CBA. It is not worth more curious propoſall and proof: ſince the truth thereof is ſo farre from giving a reaſon of the yearly alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Flux and Reflux, that it is quite repugnant with the hiſtory thereof. For according to this device of
<hi>Galilaeo</hi> the greateſt Flux and Reflux ſhould be in the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56208:223"/>ſolſtices, But according to the obſervation of Writers it is in the Aequinoxes.</p>
                        <p>But however it was a witty attempt of <hi>Galilaeo,</hi> though not altogether ſo ſolid. Mounſieur <hi>Des Chartes</hi> in my judgement is far more ſucceſſefull in his Hypotheſis, who renders the cauſes of all theſe <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>For your more fully underſtanding of what I am now about to premiſe, I muſt refer to you <hi>Des Chartes</hi> his <hi>Principia Philoſophiae.</hi> Mean while peruſe this preſent Scheme.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Where CDBE is that great Vortex, in which, and by
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56208:223"/>which the Planets are carried from Weſt to Eaſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of CDBE. Let A be the Sun, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of this great Vortex, about which all the liquid matter of our Heaven is carried about, as groſſe water in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooll; and with it the Planets like corks or ſtrawes. Let F be the Planet, we are in, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth, which is the Centre of a leſſer Vortex HDGI. Let M be the Moon carried about the earths Vortex in her monethly courſe. This Vortex of the earth is not perfect ſphericall, but cometh nearer the figure of an Ellipſis.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe as <hi>Charteſius</hi> giveth you to underſtand, that part of the Vortex, which is the Circuit KL is more like the matter of the Vortex HDGI, then that matter which is above or below at D and I; and therefore DHIG, giveth out more eaſily and naturally toward K and L.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps this reaſon may be added: That all the parts of the Vortex CDBE endeavouring through their circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion to recede from their Centre A, and thereby to widen one from another; I mean the parts of any one Circle; ſuppoſe KL: and yet all the Circles urging one another
<gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, from A, to CDBE, they will eaſily give place in their Circles, as in KL, and the reſt, but rather preſſe cloſe in the Diametre, as in DI. So that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre of the Vortex of the Earth DI, ſhall be leſſer then its Diametre GH. In ſo much that when the Moon M, is in D, or I, ſhe will ſtraiten the ſtream of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>tex a great deal more, then when ſhe is in G or H, which will make it run more ſwiftly, and bear down the Air and Water of the Sea more ſtrongly.</p>
                        <p>But now that we may come more nearly to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in hand, and apply our ſelves wholly to the Earths Vortex, in which the myſtery of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea is to be diſcovered.</p>
                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:56208:224"/>
                        <p>Let therefore this Vortex of the earth be ABCD. The Earth her ſelf EFGH. 1234. the ſurface of the ſea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with for greater perſpicuity, let the whole Earth be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: Let 5678. be the ſurface of the Air, encompaſſing the Sea.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>And now let us conſider, that if there were no Moon in this Vortex, the point T, which is the Centre of the earth, would be in the point M the Centre of the Vortex; but the Moon being at B, this Centre T muſt be betwixt M and D: becauſe ſeeing that the ethereall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Vortex is ſomething ſwiftlier moved, then the Moon or Earth which it bears along with it, unleſſe the point T, be ſomewhat more diſtant from B then D, the Moons being there would hinder the ethereal matter from flowing ſo freely betwixt B and T, as betwixt T and D. <pb n="399" facs="tcp:56208:224"/>Wherefore the poſition of the Earth in this Vortex not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined, but from the equality of force of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall matter that flows about it, it is manifeſt that ſhe muſt come ſomewhat nearer toward D.</p>
                        <p>And after the ſame manner when the Moon is in C, the Centre of the Earth muſt be betwixt M and A; and thus alwayes will the Earth recede ſomewhat from the Moon. Furthermore, becauſe that from the Moons being in B, not onely that ſpace which is betwixt B &amp; T but alſo that betwixt T and D is made narrower; hence cometh it to paſſe that the ethereall matter floweth ſwiftlier in thoſe places, and therefore preſſeth harder both upon the ſurface of the Air, in 6. and 8. as alſo upon the waters ſurface in 2. and 4. then if the Moon were not in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametre BD. And ſithence the bodies of Air and Water be fluid, and eaſily yielding to that preſſure, they muſt needs abate more in their height upon the parts of Earth, at FH; then if the Moon were out of the Diametre BD. But contrary wiſe, they muſt become higher at G and E, in ſo much that the ſurface of Water 1.3. and of Air 5.7. will be there protuberant.</p>
                        <p>But now becauſe that part of the Earth, which at this moment is in F (over againſt B) where the Sea is at the loweſt, will after ſix houres be in G (over againſt the point C) where it is at the higheſt, and after other ſix houres in H over againſt D, and ſo on. Or rather, becauſe the Moon her ſelf alſo in the interim, maketh ſome little progreſſe from B towards C, as finiſhing her whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ABCD in the ſpace of a moneth; that part of the Earth which is now in F over againſt the body of the Moon, after ſix houres and about 12. minutes, will have reached the point G in a Diametre of the Vortex ABCD which cuts that Diametre BD in which the Moon then is, to right angles, and then will the water be at higheſt <pb n="400" facs="tcp:56208:225"/>there, <hi>viz.</hi> at F. And after other ſix houres and twelve minutes, F will have reached the point H, where the water will be at loweſt ebb, &amp;c. VVhence we may clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the water of the ſea muſt in the ſame place ebb and flow every twelve houres and 24. minutes.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it is to be noted that this Vortex ABCD is not exactly round, but that diametre of it in which the Moon is at full and change to be ſhorter then that which is cut by it to right angles, as is above demonſtrated. Whence it follows that the Flux &amp; Reflux of the ſea ought to be greater at new and full Moon then in the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſeaſons.</p>
                        <p>VVe may alſo note, that whereas the Moon is alwayes in a Plain near to the Plain of the Ecliptick, and the earth is in her diurnall motion, turn'd according to the Plane of the Aequatour, which Planes interſect one another in the Aequinoxes, but be much diſtant from one another in the Solſtices, that the greateſt Flux and Reflux will be about the beginning of Spring and Autumne.</p>
                        <p>And theſe principles of <hi>Monſ. des Chartes</hi> as they are plain and perſpicuous in themſelves, ſo are they alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeable with the <gap reason="foreign">

For this reaſon I ſay, may A rightly be called the largeſt Baſis of the Cone, whoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametre is IM, or NL, as the deſcent of theſe Degrees and Beings from <hi>Ahad</hi> or
<hi>Atove</hi> may fitly reſemble a Conicall figure whoſe Cuſpis is G.</p>
                     <p>And here I may ſeaſonably appeal unto the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of men, whether the divine fecundity A flow'd out <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> and produced onely the Orb G, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there being a poſſibility of more excellent intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Orbs, (I will not ſtand upon this number I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned) he did not produce BCD, &amp;c. And if he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced G onely, whether that Orb G be not either an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious or naturall efflux from A. i.e. dependeth on him as cloſely and intimately, as a Ray doth on the Sun. And if ſo, why the nature of <hi>Atove</hi> ſhould be leſſe fruitfull,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:56208:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>then the imaginations of men, who can in reaſon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct notion place ſeverall Orbs betwixt A and G. Or why the free will of <hi>Atove</hi> or <hi>Ahad</hi> ſhould be leſſe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull then the minds of well meaning men, who if it were in their power as it is in the arbitrarious power of <hi>Ahad,</hi> (it claſhing with no other good attribute) would fill up that empty gulf betwixt A and G. Wherefore as farre as free reaſon and authority of <hi>Platoniſme</hi> will reach, the myſtery of the Cone will hold good, though my drift at this time was rather to explane it, then confirm it.</p>
                     <p>But if any ſhould be ſo adventrous as to deny ſuch an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquity as I have deſcribed, yet in ſome ſort this adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Cone, will ſtill hold good.

We'll for the preſent take notice onely of that great circle CD, and two other remov'd from this, 23. gr. and an half, <hi>viz.</hi> EF. and GN, the one above, the other below, and laſtly two other furthermoſt circles IK and LM equidiſtant from the Poles AB.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore we are to underſtand that while the Earth moves on, that her Axis keeps not onely the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the Plane of the Ecliptick, but alſo one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant direction toward the ſame part of the Univerſe or Firmament, remaining alway parallel to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now this immutability of inclination and ſteddy dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her Axis preſuppoſed, place the Earth alſo in the firſt points of Aries Cancer and Libra, according as you ſee in the preſent Scheme.</p>
                     <p>VVe will go thorough all the foure figures, and firſt that in Capricorn. In which, becauſe the Axis AB de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines from a perpendicular, upon the Diametre of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne and Cancer, 23. grad. and an half, towards the Sun O, and the Ark AI, is 23. grad. and an half, (the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning an Hemiſphere of the Earth divided from the dark Hemiſphere by the Circle KL which <hi>Galilaeo</hi> calls <hi>Terminator lucis</hi>) this <hi>Terminator lucis</hi> KL muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide CD as being a great circle, into equall parts, but all the other as being leſſer circles into unequall; becauſe KL paſſeth not through AB the poles of all theſe Circles. And the parallel IK with all the parallels deſcribed within IK even to the pole A will be wholly in the enlightned part of the Earth, as all the oppoſite parallels from LM to the pole B, wholly in the dark. Furthermore whereas the Ark AK is equall to the Ark EC, and the Ark AE common: theſe two, KIE and AEC will be equall, and each of them make a quadrant. And becauſe the whole Ark KEL is a
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56208:233"/>Semicircle, the Ark LE will be a quadrant and equall to the other EK, and therefore the Sun O ſhall in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Earth be verticall at Noon to all them that live in the Parallel EF which is the Tropick of Cancer deſcribed by the Earths turning upon her own Axis in that poſture. And thus ariſeth the height of Summer to all them that dwell on this ſide of the Tropick of Cancer.</p>

                     <p>Alſo that the differences of the arks grow bigger and bigger by how much nearer and nearer they come to the Poles, till IK be wholly taken in to the enlightned part of the Earth and make day there, of 24 houres long, and contrariwiſe, the parallel LM be wholly covered in the dark part, and make night of 24. houres long. So that from hence we may ſee how the true differences of the loweſt and ſhorteſt dayes and nights are cauſed to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſeverall parallels of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Lets now conſider the third figure the centre of the earth plac'd in <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> from whence the ſun will appear in the firſt point of Capricorn. Now it is manifeſt, being that the inclination and direction of the Earths Axis AB is utterly the ſame it was before, it remaining parallel to it ſelf, that the ſituation of the Earth is the ſame, ſaving that that Hemiſphere which was before enlightned is now in the dark, and that which was in the dark before, is now in the light, and ſo the differences of dayes and nights are quite contrary to what they were. In what parallel was the longeſt day before is now the ſhorteſt, and in what the ſhorteſt now the longeſt, as is plain to fight.</p>
                     <p>For now IK is wholly in the dark which before was in the light wholly, and LM in the light that was before in the dark <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Sun is now verticall to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>GN</hi> as before it was to them of EF. And as it was the height of Summer before to EF and to all on this ſide EF: ſo it is now the depth of winter to them and to all on this ſide of them. Eor the Sun ſeems to have deſcended, or is removed from them, or they from, it by the whole arch FDN that is 47. degrees.</p>
                     <p>All which mutation proceeds from the immutable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the axis of the Earth, remaining ſtill in the ſame inclination to the Plane of the Ecliptick and continuing <pb n="418" facs="tcp:56208:234"/>ever parallell to it ſelf.

                     <p>THus have I run through the more obſcure terms in the preceding Poems. But for the many points a man may meet withall therein, though I did heretofore make ſome ſleight promiſe of ſpeaking more determinately of them, I hope I may without offence decline the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance as yet, till I abound more with leaſure and judgement. For as I am certain I have little enough of the one, ſo I can not but doubt (Nature having laviſhed ſo much upon all men elſe, even to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Determining of mutuall contradictions) whether I have got any ſhare at all of the other. But yet I hope, without breach of modeſty, I may preſume to underſtand the purpoſe of my own writings. Which, as I have heretofore ſignified was no other then this, to ſtirre men up to take into their thoughts theſe two main conſiderations. The heartie good will of God to mankind, even in the life of this world, made of the commixture of light and darkneſſe, that he will through his power reſcue thoſe ſouls, that are faithfull in this their triall, and preferre the light before the dark; that he will, I ſay, deliver them from the power of living Death, and Hell, by that ſtrong arm of their ſalvation, Jeſus Chriſt, the living God enthron'd in the heart of man, to whom all the Genii of the Univerſe, be they never ſo goodly and glorious ſhall ſerve. They and all their curious devices and inventions ſhall be a ſpoil, prey, and a poſſeſſion to Him that is moſt juſt, and ſhall govern the nations in righteouſneſſe and equity. And that, beſide this happineſſe on earth, every holy ſoul hereafter ſhall enjoy a never-fading felicity in the inviſible and eternall Heaven, the Intellectuall world. Which if it be not true, I muſt needs confeſſe, it ſeems almoſt indifferent whether any creature be or no. For what is it to have lived, ſuppoſe 70 years, wherein we have been dead or worſe above two third parts of them? Sleep, youth, age and diſeaſes, with a number of poor and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble employments, ſwallow up at leaſt ſo great a portion: that as good, if not better, is he that never was, then he is, that hath but ſuch a glance or glimpſe of paſſing life to mock him.</p>
                     <p>And although the ſucceſſion of righteouſneſſe upon earth may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeem a goodly great and full ſpread thing, and a matter that may bear an ample correſpondencie even to the larger thoughts of a good
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:56208:243"/>and upright man; yet, to ſay the truth, no man is capable of any large inheritance, whoſe life and exiſtence is ſo ſcant that he ſhall not be able ſo much as to dream of the leaſt happineſſe once ſeiſed on by death.</p>
                     <p>But there are continually on earth ſuch numbers of men alive, that if they liv'd well it would be an Heaven or Paradiſe. But ſtill a ſcant one to every particular man, whoſe dayes are even as nothing. So that the work of God ſeems not conſiderable, in the making of this world, if humane ſouls be extinguiſhed when they go out of it. You will ſay that thoſe ſmall particles of time that is thus ſcattered and loſt among men in their ſucceſſions, are comprehended and collected in God who is a continuall witneſſe of all things.</p>
                     <p>But, alas! what doth the perpetuall repetition of the ſame life or dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Image throughout all ages adde to Him, that is at once infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelf, viz. good, and happy?</p>
                     <p>So that there is nothing conſiderable in the creation, if the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall creature be mortall. For neither is God at all profited by it, nor man conſiderably. And were not the Angels a great deal better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the beholding the worth of their Creatour, then to deminiſh their own happineſſe, by attending thoſe, whom nothing can make happy? looking on this troubled paſsing ſtream of the periſhing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of men, to as little purpoſe almoſt, as idle boyes do on dancing blebs and bubbles in the water.</p>
                     <p>What deſigne therefore can there be in God in the making of this world that will prove <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, worthy of ſo excellent a goodneſſe and wiſdome; but the triall of the immortall ſpirit of man? It ſeems the deepeſt reach of his counſell in the creation; and the life of this world but a prelude to one of longer durance and larger circumference hereafter. And ſurely it is nothing elſe but the heavy load of this body, that keeps down our mind from the reaching to thoſe ſo high hopes, that I may not ſay from a certain ſenſe and feeling of that undiſturbd ſtate of immortality.</p>
                     <p>And thus much I have ventured to ſpeak boldly without
<hi>Scepticiſme</hi> in Faith and Senſe, that the firſt Principle of all things is living Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, armd with Wiſdome &amp; all-powerfull Love. But if a mans ſoul be once ſunk by evil fate or deſert from the ſenſe of this high and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth, into that cold conceit; that the Originall of things doth lie either in ſhuffling Chance, or in that ſtark root of unknowing Nature and brute Neceſſity; all the ſubtile cords of Reaſon, without the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovery of that divine touch within the hidden ſpirit of man, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
